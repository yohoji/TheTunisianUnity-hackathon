# What is The Tunisian Unity?
This is a startup project idea founded by 3 members during the Hackathon event "INNOV IT" celebrating the 20th anniversary of the "Jeunes Ing√©nieurs" club at ISAMM Tunisia.


# The Main idea of our project:
We wanted to focus on one of the main social issues in our country which is poverty, 
The idea was to make a low-profit fundraising site for the poor which was more focused on children.


# Why did you choose making a website and not a mobile application for your project?
We wanted to make it a website since we wanted the maximum amount of people to reach out and donate,
since a website could be accessed more easily and anywhere in public on any device(pc or mobile).


# How does the fundraising works?
It's very simple, once you enter the site, you'll find a big yellow button called "spread hope",
once you click on it you'll be redirected to the payment page,
and like that you'll be able to spansor a child and make their future better.

# What makes your fundraising project special compared to others in Tunisia?
We don't just receive funds from people and give it to poor children, 
we also plan on organizing public events with others (individuals/organizations/companies/etc...),
which will further increase our site popularity and make our community bigger.

# How can someone trust you with their donations?
We also have all kinds of social pages,
where we post images and videos of the children's smiles once donations reach their destination
in order to keep our community updated.
